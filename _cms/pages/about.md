  headlineHighlight: "\"Personal Branding\""
  headlineEnd: "Was a Thing"
  paragraphs:
    - "In 2014, I was a journalist watching something unfold that now seems obvious: brands on social were reaching more people than the publications I was writing for."
    - "Meanwhile, those same brands were spending tens of thousands to get publicists to convince journalists to tell their story… badly. They could've told it themselves: faster, cheaper, and far more effectively."
    - "So I built an agency that helped music festivals like Tomorrowland and brands like Red Bull do exactly that."
    - "Nine years later, Magnate is the second iteration of the same insight:"
  emphasis: "You don't need media gatekeepers. You can tell your own story, better than they ever could."

    - "What they lack is experience. Judgment. A sense of stakes. An understanding of public perception."
  emphasis: "Magnate is built for the founders who need more than templates and tactics."
  emphasisText: "They need a partner who actually understands what needs to be said — and what must stay unsaid."
